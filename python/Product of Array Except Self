Time complexity is O(n) - because all for loops are at same level
Space complexity is O(n) 

nums → input array (not counted as extra space)

L → size = length

R → size = length

answer → size = length

So you have 3 arrays, each of size n (where n = length).

Total extra space = n + n + n = 3n.

In Big-O notation, we ignore constants, so 3n becomes:

👉 O(n) extra space.

class Solution:
    def productExceptSelf(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:

        length = len(nums)

        L, R, answer = [0] * length, [0] * length, [0] * length

        L[0], R[-1] = 1,1

        for i in range(length-1):

            L[i+1] = L[i] * nums[i]
        
        for i in reversed(range(length-1)):

            R[i] = R[i+1] *nums[i+1]

        for i in range(length):

            answer[i] = L[i] * R[i]
        
        return answer
