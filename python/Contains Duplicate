https://leetcode.com/problems/contains-duplicate/

Time complexity is O(n) - iterates through list once and in set any operation is O(1) - insert, search & delete.
Space complexity is O(n) - we are use set data structure to store the values.

Why sets?
set and dictionaries stores values in a hash table. complete scan is not needed with a hash value you can directly goto the value. since we have only values no key using sets to save the memory and sets dont store duplicates.
If we lists then we have scan entire list to find the duplicate which increase time complexity by O(n2).
